# POST_PC_EX1

I do solemnly swear, that I will administer justice without respect to persons, 
and do equal right to the poor and to the rich, and that I will faithfully 
and impartially discharge and perform all the duties incumbent on me, according 
to the best of my abilities and understanding, agreeably to the Course Guidelines, 
and laws of the Hebrew University. [So help me God.]
